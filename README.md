## Story
Our project was inspired by some of the most popular first person shooters. In our opinion, the games we most enjoy consist of fast paced movement and projectile based shooting mechanics. We decided to focus on these mechanics to craft an enjoyable player experience for gamers with the same taste. This project was the first time either of us had used Unity or C#, and it turned out to be a great learning experience.  

## Challenges
The biggest challenegs we faced were related to implementing multiplayer into the game. Making sure everything gets sent over the network correctly, and that every player is only controlling what they should be can get confusing. We went back and forth multiple times between having client-side and server-side hit detection. Most of the other challenegs we had revolved around being unfirmilar with Unity and C#.
